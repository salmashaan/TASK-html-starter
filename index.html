      <p>Oh This Is Us…

        One of the most heart-warming and raw TV shows I have ever seen. The way they make you fall in love with each and every character regardless of their flaws is beyond imagination. All the characters are so thought-out and timeless. There is no effort to make this show modernized to a specific group of people like many of the other shows in the industry today. <br/><br/>
        
        This show started last year with a cast no one could ever imagine, including Gilmore Girls and Heroes one and only, Milo Ventimiglia and also Mandy Moore. Each actor consumed their role and perfected them in a way I have never seen anywhere else. The theme of this show is family. What I like most about it, is the way it is presented it innovative. It shifts back and forth from the past to the present eloquently and in a manner that only someone who pays attention will understand. What I mean by this, is they don’t make it obvious when they are in the past and when they are in the present. You as an audience should make the connection and decipher which is which. The first episode was confusing because this is a new approach to filming that I have never encountered before. But even though that is true, the production adds subtle hints for you to notice and realize the difference. In the pilot, only towards the end did I realize that the baby triplets in the first couple of scenes with two young parents, and the three full grown adults in the other scenes are the same people. The only hints they showed in the scenes where we were in the past were, for example, patients and doctors smoking inside a hospital. This minor detail and many more like it is what helps us, as viewers, distinguish the past from the present. <br/><br/>
        
        With all honestly, I cried in almost every episode. Yes, I did. The show is so emotional but not in a sense of sadness, yet in a sense of attachment to the characters. You see them go through ups and downs in their past and present, and without realizing it, you go through it with them. This isn’t an easy thing to accomplish as producers, therefore I applaud them for being able to add this intrinsic beauty and raw feeling to a 2D screen. <br/><br/>
        
        The storyline is simple. It started off with a mother very clearly pregnant with triplets. She and her husband later found out one of their triplets is stillborn, but they “take the sourest lemon life has to offer and make something resembling lemonade” (A famous quote from the show). They did that by adopting a baby boy who was left at a fire station the same day they lost their third child. The story later evolves into the parenting of these triplets, their lives as adults, and the lives of the parents as well.</p>

      <h3><b>GAME OF THRONES</b></h3>
      <h5>Fantasy, Serial drama, Tragedy, <span class="w3-opacity">September 27, 2021</span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I don’t think words will ever suffice to appreciate this phenomenon. Yes, phenomenon. This is not just a show, or a source of entertainment, Game of Thrones is milestone in the world’s mere existence. I have never and probably will never watch anything this good.<br/><br/>

        With full confidence and without a shred of guilt towards all the other shows I watch, I can say this is by far my all time favorite. Game of Thrones started in 2011 and is still in business. In their latest season, season seven, they accumulated above 30 million views in the US alone. The production company, HBO, understood how crucial making a perfect episode was, and for that, each episode costs approximately $10 million. That did not go unnoticed, for the show acquired more than 38 awards, according to CNBC. <br/><br/>
        
        Enough about the statistics, what is the show about? The show basically revolves around power, family, and war. This might seem like the basic elements to any hit show, but the way it is presented is unprecedented. The show is based on a series of novels by George R. R. Martin, called A Song of Ice and Fire. The setting of this show is in a different world than the one we know today. The continents and countries are all scattered differently on the map, as you can see below. The fictional continents are Westeros and Esos. The characters in this show are too many to mention in this post, and even too many for me myself, a die hard fan, to remember. But that is the beauty of this show, you are never bored.<br/><br/>
        
        There are three main storylines concurrently happening throughout the show. The first is the political feud between noble families and those who believe they have the rightful claim to the Iron Throne. The Iron Throne is the highest possible ranking and the one who claims it is the ruling monarch of the Seven Kingdoms. These Seven Kingdoms are: The North, The Iron Islands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Stormlands, The Reach, and Dorne. And for each Kingdom there is a ruling family, thus the feud for power.<br/><br/>
        
        The second story line is about House Targaryen. This house was originally the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, and for circumstances too complex for me to talk about, they were exiled. In the show, up to the latest season *SPOILER ALERT* there was only one remaining Targaryen descendant, Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen a.k.a. the Mother of Dragons. This storyline revolves around her, and her effort to reclaim her throne.<br/><br/>
        
        Finally, the third is the one revolving around The Wall. The Wall and the Night’s Watch are basically the protectors of the realm. The Wall is a huge ice structure that surrounds the border of the Seven Kingdoms, and the Night’s Watch are the ones were sworn to protect it.<br/><br/>
        
        I’m sure you’ve all heard the saying “Winter is Coming” at least once in the past seven years. Yes ladies and gentlemen, that saying is most definitely from Game of Thrones. Winter is the common enemy that no one can conquer, and is feared by the weakest and the greatest.<br/><br/>
        
        This fictional fantasy includes dragons, White Walkers, Children of the Forest, and The Three-Eyed Raven. The show is too intricate and mind blowing to fathom. The characters overlap in so many areas that you, sometimes, get lost. The setting of each kingdom is beyond beautiful filming in places like Belfast and Croatia.<br/><br/>
        
        The show is the definition of “expect the unexpected.” The way they relate minor events in season one, to major themes and plots happening in season seven is astonishing. You have to be ready to get attached to characters who will eventually be killed off with no warnings. No matter how much I try to analyze the scenes, read theories, and power all my attention on figuring out what’s going to happen next, I am always wrong. But once again, that is the beauty of it. This show, in my opinion, will be remembered forever in history. It brings people together around the world. I remember walking into a random store in Greece, when my phone rang to the theme song of Game of Thrones, and, like a reflex, the employee turned to me with obvious recognition. I stayed in that store for over an hour just talking about the show, the characters, and expectations about the upcoming season. I truthfully feel like there should be classes in universities around the world teaching the talented complexity and addictive beauty behind Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>
        
        I think I wrote more than I should have, but I truly hope, for your sakes, that my enthusiasm somewhat convinced you to give the show a try. I promise you, you wont’t regret it.

      <h4><b>About the Guru</b></h4>
      <p>My name is Shahad Al Mashan, and I don’t watch shows once a week, I’m more of a season a day kind of person. Watching TV shows is, sadly, one of my greatest talents. I watch almost everything, from Disney shows to Game of Thrones. I decided to start this blog to help people navigate and find the TV show they are looking for. Every post, I will be talking about a different show or episode describing the pros and the cons of it, and giving my opinion about it. <br/><br/>

        P.S. Watch out for spoilers in some posts.</p>
